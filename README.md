Advanced React – Refactoring to Functional Components with Hooks

**Plan**: Refactor class components to functional components using Hooks.

I’ll be starting the week by transitioning some older React code from class components to functional components using the Hooks API. This will involve:

- Replacing lifecycle methods with `useEffect` for handling side effects.
- Using `useState` for managing local state.
- Simplifying the code and improving readability.

This exercise is a great way to get back into the rhythm of using modern React features and will set me up for more advanced state management techniques in the future.
