# State and Methods

## Refactor a Class Component with State and Methods

- Choose a class component that has state and custom methods for handling state changes (e.g., a counter with increment/decrement).
- Refactor it to use `useState` and functional updates.

**Extra Challenge**: Create a custom hook for the counter logic to encapsulate state management.
