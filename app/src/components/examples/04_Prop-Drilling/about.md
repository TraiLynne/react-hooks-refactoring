# Prop-Drilling

## Refactor a Component with Prop-Drilling Issues

- Identify a class-based component that passes down props through multiple child components.
- Refactor it using the `useReducer` hook for state management and pass state through React Context instead of prop drilling.

**Extra Challenge**: Combine `useContext` and `useReducer` in a custom hook for better state management.
