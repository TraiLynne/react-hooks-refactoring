# Simple Form

## Refactor a Simple Form Component

- Take an existing class-based form component and refactor it to use `useState` for form state management.
- Use `useEffect` to perform form validation or side effects based on form input changes.

**Extra Challenge**: Implement form input debouncing using `useEffect` and `setTimeout`.
