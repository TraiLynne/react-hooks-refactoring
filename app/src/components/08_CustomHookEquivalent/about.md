# Custom Hook

## Refactor a Component Using a Custom Hook

- Create a custom hook to encapsulate logic from a class component (e.g., a timer or theme toggle).
- Refactor the component to use the custom hook, simplifying its code.

**Extra Challenge**: Refactor multiple components to use the custom hook and ensure it works seamlessly across different use cases.
